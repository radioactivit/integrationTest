# Join THE team

## Welcome strangers

If you clone this repo, you're on the way to join a really great team : ours.

You'll be faced to three challenges for your test :

* A simple algorythm exercice type fizzbuzz (but not fizzbuzz, we're serious business).
* A simple clone, docker, branch, debug, demo, push.
* A database optimisation

## The algorythm exercice

Depend on our humor, you'll see on site.

## The debug

Unfortunately, your predecessor has deliver an unfunctionnal TicTacToe Game made with react. The client said the game can't handle diagonal winner.

Fortunately, you're here to save the day. You have to : 

* Clone this repository on your machine
* Launch the docker and create your test interface
* Create a branch named after you
* Patch the problem
* Shows us and explain your patch
* Commit and push your branch

## The database
