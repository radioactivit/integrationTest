# Join THE team

## Welcome strangers

If you clone this repo, you're on the way to join a really great team : ours.

You'll be faced to three challenges for your test :

* A simple algorithm exercice like fizzbuzz (but not fizzbuzz, we're serious business).
* A simple clone, docker, branch, debug, demo, push.
* A database optimisation

Unfortunately, your predecessor has delivered an unfunctionnal TicTacToe Game made with react. The client said the game can't handle diagonal winner.

Fortunately, you're here to save the day. You have to : 

* Clone this repository on your machine
* Go to the app folder
* Launch the docker and create your test interface
* Create a branch named after you
* Patch the problem
* Show us and explain your patch
* Commit and push your branch

## The database

You'll find another docker in the sql repository and a database named Sakila. Now launch this new container, import the data in a database and answer the following questions with the right query :

* How many "film" in the db?
